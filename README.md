# Java Spring Boot Project with Event Sourcing and CQRS

## Overview

This project is a Java Spring Boot application that leverages the Event Sourcing and CQRS architectural patterns. It employs EventStoreDB as the write database for storing events and PostgreSQL with JPA for read and projection purposes.

## Features

- **Event Sourcing and CQRS:** Embrace the Event Sourcing pattern to persist changes as a sequence of events and the CQRS pattern to separate read and write operations, enhancing scalability and flexibility.

- **EventStoreDB (Write Database):** Utilize EventStoreDB as the write database for storing events generated by command operations.

- **PostgreSQL and JPA (Read Database):** Leverage PostgreSQL as the read database and utilize JPA for efficient handling of queries and projections.
